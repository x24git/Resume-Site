                        and security architecture and design reviews. Since joining the program we
                        have successfully reduced the defect density for newly introduced code by 87%, while at the same
                        time working with relevant teams to reduce the backlog of defects at a rate that will result in

                        a reported 50% drop in turn around time for document generation. One of my major milestones was

                        traffic to determine if a network was compromised or a host was infected. In this capacity, I
                        gained valuable insight into vendor specific logs (Splunk, Palo Alto, Fortigate, Microsoft ATA)
                        as well as a comprehensive understanding of suspicious traffic patterns and connections.

                    <p>A complete system that allowed music being played on a computer to be visualized by a strip of
                        LEDs (ideally placed within a windowed computer case). The project was composed of two parts:
                        The Arduino that controlled the LEDs and the <a href="https://processing.org/"><b>Processing</b></a>
                        program that converted the sound being played to data the Arduino could interpret. Upon sound
                        being played, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"><b>FFT
                            process</b></a> was run on the sound, which was then processed to produce a number of
                        frequency buckets. Each bucket was assigned a slightly different hue, such that the frequency
                        range corresponded with a range of hue values. The hue was then broken up into its respective
                        RGB values and transmitted over <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter"><b>UART</b></a>
                        to the Arduino. The Arduino then took the data and displayed it visually, either as a pulse,
                        wave, or solid color transition effect. A Processing GUI allowed for a rotation of the hue
                        spectrum and brightness controls. </p>

            <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
            <p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time working on personal projects ranging anywhere
                from creating over the top contraptions controlled by an Arduino to building Ikea furniture. I also
                spend my time keeping up to date on the latest security vulnerabilities and trying new things in my home
                lab. To unwind I enjoy "bad" sci-fi movies (Starship Troopers and Oblivion anyone?), living a second
                life as a mayor / benevolent god in Cities: Skylines (aka SimCity, but actually enjoyable) and when I
                have time, I do my level best to not burn down my kitchen - and sometimes the food is actually really
                good.</p>
            <p class="mb-0"> When I'm not cooped up indoors, I love backpacking and camping. Living in the traffic
                monster that is Los Angeles, it is always magical to see the untapped majesty of our National Parks. Of
                course even LA can be an interesting sight from <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmkiLKatIG1yvcj3hAmm8_A67-wfnYVc7"><b>the
                    air</b></a>. Being close to the Pacific Ocean automatically makes me partial to water;
                I do enjoy a nice day out kayaking or paddle boarding. In general, if something is able to break
                me away from my normal routine, sign me up. </p>
