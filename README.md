## About

your personal site, or anything else.

## Download and Installation

To begin using this template, choose one of the following options to get started:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/x24git/Resume-Site.git`
* [Fork, Clone, or Download on GitHub](https://github.com/x24git/Resume-Site)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and SASS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make
changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you
make to the code, you will need to build the project using Webpack.

After installation, run `npm run-script watch` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser,
watch for
changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `webpack.config.js`
to
see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### NPM Tasks

- `npm run-script build` the default task that builds everything for deployment
- `npm run-script watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made

You must have NPM installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
